# inassatus_deeplearning
creating my own deeplearning library


In this project, I build the whole deep learning neural network in my way.
Some algorithms in this repo may not accord to the usual deeplearning algorithms that you used to implement.
However, it follows the track anyways. Example, backpropagation, mutation, and generation  etc...


Too lazy to implement the file stream methods which may be used for saving and training the network.
